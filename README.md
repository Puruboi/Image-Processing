# Objective: To segment and count all the lemons present in an image given by the user
## Task 1: Counting Lemons
"""evelop a python based tool to read an image given by the user, segment and count the number
of lemons in the image. Accept the image input by the user and display the result along with
each lemon segmented separately, count of lemons in the image and time taken for code to
execute. Generalize the thresholds in your code so as to detect and count lemons in a variety of
images. A test set of images is provide in this link for you to test your code and improve its
performance """

"""Use Google Colab Notebooks to complete the task stated above, test your code on the test set of
images provided, display the results for all the images in the test set and share the file through
mail. Enable access to the file before sending.
Rules and Guidelines:
1. Candidates are not allowed to use a Deep Learning based approach.
2. Count predictions should be generated in less than 300 milliseconds.
3. Explain your approach to solving the task in the form of comments in the code. Any code
file without appropriate commenting will not be accepted and the candidate will not be
considered for further rounds of the interview.
4. Submission of complete code is in terms of shareable Google Colab Notebook file. Any
other form of submission is allowed."""
